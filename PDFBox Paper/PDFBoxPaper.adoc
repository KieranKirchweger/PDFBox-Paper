# Manipulating PDFs in Java with Apache PDFBox

## Table of Content

## Getting Started
For this paper, we will create a maven project to showcase different usages for the PDFBox library. First we need to add PDFBox to our project.

To do that, simply add the following to your Maven project's pom.xml in the `dependencies` section:

[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.pdfbox</groupId>
    <artifactId>pdfbox</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.27</version>
</dependency>
----

Then reload your dependencies and you're good to go.
